# YLab Hackathon

YLab shop is a all in one plateform to manage a virtual shop during the Hackathon event. Each team has a budget to spend in the shop to buy services, tools, and resources to help them with their projects. The shop is designed to be user-friendly and efficient, allowing teams to quickly find and purchase what they need.

The plateform also includes an admin interface for the Hackathon organizers to handle the shop requests (accept, partially accept, refuse) and manage the inventory of items rented in order to have a way to track what has been rented and by whom.
It also gives basic tools to manage the creation of teams (when you don't know the amount of students that will come...)
